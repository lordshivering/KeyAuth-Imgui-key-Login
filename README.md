# KeyAuth-Imgui-key-Login
This is a imgui login that runs with keyauth with only uses the key and has tabs for you to paste your stuff in c++

I dont think i will expand from this it works perfect 
If libs say usesd and need some just redownload and replace them


How to do it:

Download the libs.rar from KeyAuth.com ( https://github.com/KeyAuth/KeyAuth-CPP-Example/blob/main/libs.zip )

Extract libs.rar into the folder

open the .sln file

change to Release mode and x64

Change your Secret,Owner id etc. (found on KeyAuth)

build it!
